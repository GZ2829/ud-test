## Thanks For Looking!

Hi, Thank you for taking the time to look at my submission. I wanted to make the challenge a little more challenging. So I chose to do both Vue and Tailwind without building it through the Vue cli and instead do everything through CDN. Its nice because it makes the codebase much more light and easy to manage, this sort of method was seen as advantageous to use with WP or Shopify for this reason. However for a production codebase this method isn't really supported, so I did it as more of a "I can do it" rather then saying it should be done this way.

Please note: While I had a easy time finding the 'Lato' font. Didot turned into an issue and the type of didot I use is different then the one used in your design. I apologize for the inconvenience


## How To Run

To run this codebase, you would simply have to download or clone this repository. Then either go to the index.html file through your browser or go into the repo through your shell and type in the command for your browser along with index.html. So for example, if you were using firefox: 

  ```sh
    firefox index.html
  ```
